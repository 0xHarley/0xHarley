<h1 align="center">I'm Shaimaa</h1> 

Since I found out that I have no life, I let down my Medical degree, packed my backpack and moved to Cyber Security field ${{\color{red}Insane\ Right?\ Now\ You\ Know\ Why\ Harley\ Quinn\ Reassembles\ Me}}$ ðŸ˜„

Let's take it more seriously, I'm an addicted Blue teamer who currently works as a SOC Analyst and don't mind to spend the whole day analyzing/building attacks scenarioes, In fact the most part I love about my job is that I can read minds. 

Currently working on improving my Coding/Scripting skills since one year ago, the only thing I Knew about Computer Science was how to start and shutdown my laptop.

Passionate about everything comes in ${{\color{blue} BLUE}}$ that's why I'm interested in Incident Response, Threat Hunting, Threat Detection, Threat Emulation and Digital Forensics, and I belivie that knowledge is POWER so I want to keep learning to above and beyond.
